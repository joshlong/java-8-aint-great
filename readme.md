# Java 8 Ain't Great

Java 8 ain't great. Consider this plugin your Spring Intervention!

## installation 

* Clone this repository to your local filesystem, note its new location
* In Google Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`, then choose `load unpacked`, and point it to the newly cloned git repository.  It'll be looking for the file `manifest.json` in the root of the repository.

## todo 

- I want to have a Youtube video of me, in the Spring shirt, frantically running into the room to hit a button to disengage the blaring alarm. 
- then I'll come back into scene and address the audience. "What's wrong with you?? Are you from the distant, distant past?.."
- we'll need to synchronize the strobe stop to the exact moment I stop the alarm in the video. We'll need sound effects to play for the large doors opening. We'll need image textures for the 'doors', too.
